blocklists2rpz
==============

A bash script to download blocklists and convert them to a response policy zone
which bind9 can use


Usage
-----

    blocklists2rpz [LIST-OF-LISTS-URL]

This downloads the url given as first parameter and downloads each list
mentioned where. Those lists will be merged, filtered and outputted as response
policy zone-file. Output is written to STDOUT.

Additionally the list is filtered:

- duplicates are removed
- invalid hostnames and ip addresses (for lists in the /etc/hosts-format) will
  be removed
- subdomains for parent-domains already in the filter-list will be omitted

For each hostname a 'CNAME .' record is created. This makes bind9 respond with
NXDOMAIN. To block possible subdomains another record for '*.<hostname>' is
created.

If the scripts first and only parameter is omited, the blocklists of
<https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick> will be used.


Installation
------------

Just download the script and execute it.

Additionally a package for Debian is available in the releases section.  You
can build and install it with:

    $ make deb
    # apt-get install debian/blocklists2rpz-0.1.0.deb
